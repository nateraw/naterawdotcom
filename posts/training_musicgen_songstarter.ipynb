    "## My Background in Music\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I got into programming, I used to spend my free time producing music. I spent countless hours in middle school downloading various software onto the family computer and infecting it with viruses (sorry Mom!). Nobody I knew at school was into that sort of thing, so I had to go online to find folks like me who were tinkering with music production. Once I found a few friends via [what I imagine were] Soundcloud DMs, we formed a Facebook group to chat, collaborate, share our music, and ask technical questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was one of my first real experiences with an online, collaborative community. It was such a beautiful thing. Through collaborating with folks in this group, I was \"signed\" to a couple record labels and released tracks on Beatport. In hindsight, the \"labels\" were probably just some dudes in their basement taking advantage of kids like me, but it was still fun to get my music out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "As time went on, I got less interested in EDM and more into instrumental hip-hop/experimental music. I started producing, mixing, and mastering for local artist friends of mine. I stopped trying to market my music and just made music for myself, sometimes sharing links with friends and family. Felt more fun this way. At some point along the way, I started ramping up learning programming and ML, and basically stopped making music altogether. Pretty lame!\n",

    "## AI music research + the MusicGen weights release\n",
    "\n",
    "I may have put my DJing career on the backburner, but over the years I've tried to keep up with the intersection of AI and music. When I saw the papers for MuLan/MusicLM, I started to get really excited. MusicLM showed a LOT of potential. But of course, Google chose not to release the weights. üò≠\n",
    "\n",
    "A year later, in Jan 2024, Meta dropped the code AND weights for MusicGen. This model was a bit simpler in architecture compared to MusicLM - it takes audio and tokenizes it with `Encodec`, then feeds it to a transformer. They showed how you could control the generation by conditioning on text, melody, metadata, etc. The hype was **real**!! üî•\n",
    "\n",
    "With the excitement also came some minor frustrations...it was exciting because it was a huge step forward in the field of AI music generation - **and** the weights were open. Frustrating because the Encodec model used to train the larger variants of MusicGen was for __**32khz mono**__ audio. A __**44.1k/48k stereo**__ MusicGen would have earth shattering for the AI community. Instead, they teased us a bit by releasing a 48k stereo `Encodec`, but made it frustrating to use in their training codebase, so nobody could practically train a new MusicGen checkpoint with it (if I'm mistaken about this, please let me know and I'll revise!). Even if you could, you'd need a bunch of compute to make it happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some time, Meta released \"stereo\" variants of the MusicGen models with a bit of a hack to interleave codebooks for left and right channels - still using the mono Encodec under the hood. I've heard these described as being \"too stereo\", which I tend to agree with. Gripes aside, these stereo models are still INCREDIBLE and I am so grateful for their release. üôè"

    "## MusicGen - will it fine-tune?\n",
    "\n",
    "A few months after the release of MusicGen, when there were still just mono models available, I started wondering: how hard it would be to fine-tune this? Just like with any large pretrained model, you often get the best results for your use case by fine-tuning on your own data. I had a hunch that fine-tuning MusicGen on a dataset of music samples could produce some really cool results.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first idea was to fine-tune on specific artists. Basically \"generate a song that sounds like \\<artist\\> made it\". My intuition was that for this to work, the style of the songs would have to be distinct. So, I started tinkering with the [audiocraft](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft) codebase, trying to figure out how the training code worked, how to format the data, etc. For me, the codebase is a bit hard to follow. Nested Hydra configs, a PyTorch trainer suite, [`flashy`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/flashy), that lives in a different github repo, an experiment manager, [`dora`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dora), that also lives in a different repo. It's a lot to take in!!\n",

    "#### Initial experiments with fine-tuning on artists\n",
    "\n",
    "After some exploration, I figured out how to get training running using their codebase, and prepared a dataset of samples from a few artists and started training for the text-to-music task, starting from the [musicgen-small](https://huggingface.co/facebook/musicgen-small) checkpoint as that was the largest model I could fit on a Google Colab A100 40gb GPU. For the dataset, since I didn't have text captions for the music, I set the captions to be the same every time: \"an electronic instrumental in the style of <artist>\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The results were...okay. I had to generate a lot of samples to get some good ones out...most were riddled with artifacts/noise/strange sounds/silence.

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not familiar - [Splice](https://splice.com) is a app most music producers use. It lets you buy samples (drum sounds, melody loops, etc) that you can use in your songs. All these years, I've been subscribed to Splice but not producing much music. As a result, I had accumulated a lot of credits. So, my plan was to download a bunch of loops from Splice and use those to train a new model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Downloading the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing too fancy here. I sat at my computer and listened to samples for a long time - listening and purchasing samples carefully. Some key notes from this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - I wanted to stick with samples that matched my taste. I went for hip hop/rap/electronic melodic loops, as well as some soul/jazz samples.\n",
    "  - I had to be careful not to download samples that were too similar to each other. Often times sample packs had complimentary samples that were too similar to each other. I wanted to make sure the model was learning a wide variety of sounds.\n",
    "  - I wanted samples to be 15-30s long (note MusicGen was trained on 30s samples).\n",
    "  - I wanted to avoid drums altogether so the model would un-learn to generate drums.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the songstarter-v0.1, I used ~600 samples. For songstarter-v0.2, I used around 1700-1800 samples - about 7-8 hours of audio altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data prep\n",

    "#### Audiocraft Woes + rewriting training w/ PyTorch Lightning\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I felt I had a good dataset to start training medium/large models, I would spin up a VM on [Lambda](https://lambdalabs.com), and try to start training with the original training code from audiocraft. Unfortunately, in addition to the codebase being hard to navigate (which I attribute to the nested Hydra configs), I ran into a lot of issues with training itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, there were bugs when using FSDP that caused deadlocks. When you're spending your own personal $$$, you want the training to be as efficient as possible, so not being able to use FSDP reliably was an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I rewrote the training loop with PyTorch Lightning, as its a nice tool to use when you're trying to focus on the model rather than the training loop. This worked. The one major headache my implementation causes is that the checkpoints are saved different than the original `audiocraft` checkpoints...but at least it works!\n",
    "\n",
    "> As a quick aside, I think some of my issues with FSDP in `audiocraft` may have been H100 specific. There are some lingering issues on their GitHub about it. My implementation also had some issues on H100 that I am not 100% sure are resolved. Had limited time to debug because every hour spent not training was ~$30. I actually ended up burning most of the credits Lambda gave me for this project just on one 12 hour session debugging FSDP issues on an 8xH100. üò≠ The final training run was done on 8xA100 40GB.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training code I used is available via my fork of the audiocraft repo [here](https://github.com/nateraw/audiocraft). Note I did not add the validation loop here - I found I was evaluating the model by generating samples and listening to them, so I didn't bother with it. Again, I was doing most of this on my own time, so I was moving quickly. Don't judge me, k? üòÖ\n",

    "\n",
    "I don't have the exact details for v0.1, which was a medium melody model, so we'll just discuss `musicgen-songstarter-v0.2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "v0.2 was fine-tuned on top of [`facebook/musicgen-stereo-melody-large`](https://huggingface.co/facebook/musicgen-stereo-melody-large) on a Lambda Labs 8xA100 40gb instance for 10k steps, which took about 6 hours. With FSDP, I could safely fit a batch size of 5 per device, so that's what I used (meaning global batch size of 40). I reduced the minimum segment duration to 15s (from the base model's 30s). The code is available [here](https://github.com/nateraw/audiocraft), but is undocumented as of now.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried a few different combos of batch size / segment duration to find what made sense for me. In the end, even though we trained on smaller samples, the model can still generate longer samples - at the cost (or benefit, depending who you ask) of the fact they are usually looping."
